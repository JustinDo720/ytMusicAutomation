# Youtube Music Download Automation

### Description:
We want to allow users to get mp3 versions of their youtube video. The user just has to put
in their youtube link and Selenium will do the work.

### Goals:
1. To make sure that the Users get the correct mp3 for their selected songs
1. Improve overall layout. For instance we dont want it staying on a console but rather a gui.
1. No pop ups. We want a robust program that waits for the download 

### Ideas:
<!-- This has to be spaced out -->
* [x] Instead of a link can we go for maybe a title and the user gets to choose?
* [x] Hook the selenium program to a gui like Tkinter
* [ ] Chrome or Firefox? Basically make the program more robust 
* [x] Is there a way to close down the pop up tabs
* [x] Move files to another destination? Can users choose?
