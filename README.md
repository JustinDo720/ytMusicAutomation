#Youtube Music Download Automation

##Description:
<p>   
  We want to allow users to get mp3 versions of their youtube video. The user just has to put
  in their youtube link and Selenium will do the work.
</p>

###Goals:
1. To clutter or false downloads
1. Improve overall layout. For instance we dont want it staying on a console but rather a gui.
1. No pop ups. We want a robust program that waits for the download 

### Ideas:
*[ ] Instead of a link can we go for maybe a title and the user gets to choose?
*[ ] Hook the selenium program to a gui like Tkinter
*[ ] Chrome or Firefox? Basically make the program more robust 
*[ ] Is there a way to close down the pop up tabs
*[ ] Move files to another destination? Can users choose?
